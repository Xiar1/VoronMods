This is my doom adaptation for micron+. Goal is for it to be almost completly printable and capable of being made without needing a teardown of the printer to move z drives and the electronics when converting to doom-micron. This allows for multiple psu's to be mounted in the top of the micron+ and have the ac and dc wires coming up and down from/to the bottom through the use of pg glands. Current setup does not require any additional hex nuts to be preloaded as the goal is to prevent a teardown. 

For now the only printed parts replaced are the top panel clips. 

Requirments:
  -4 PG9 cable glands
  -2 4010 axial fans
  -wago connectors
  -vhb
  -m3x16 bhcs
  -m3 nuts
