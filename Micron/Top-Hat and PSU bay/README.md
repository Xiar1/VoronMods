Top-Hat and/or PSU Bay mod for a Micron+. Watch the print orientation as parts were not exported in the correct orientations for printing. The corners are designed to be printed upside down and thusly have a 45 degree camfer on the bottom and a fillet on the top. 

All side pieces are designed with multicolor printing in mind. In the slicer right-click the sides and select split to parts. Then you can change the color of the middle section of them. 

3mm Foam is needed for the gap between the corner and side pieces as well for both versions.
